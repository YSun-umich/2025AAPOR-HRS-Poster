This study examines the validity of existing cognition measures across racial, ethnic, and linguistic groups using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal biennial survey that targets adults over the age of 50 in the U.S. Our study focuses on non-Latino Blacks, non-Latino Whites, and Latinos (further divided by interview language: English vs. Spanish). We examine several multi-item measures across various cognition domains. The validity of these measures will be analyzed cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. Given the established relationship between cognition and known covariates (e.g., education), we will examine similarities and differences in the pattern of this relationship across our comparison groups. With aging, a decline in cognition is expected over time. We will analyze the changes in cognition over time at the individual level and the comparability of these changes across our target groups. The results are expected to provide insights into the robustness of current survey-based cognitive measures in terms of validity and inclusivity and to guide improvements in the measurement properties of existing tools.
